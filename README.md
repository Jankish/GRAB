This program creates excel files by extracting information from .kos 
files, which are created in Lundagrossisten. The goal is reduce the 
amount of office hours spent on creating customer specification. 

## Version 1.0
Simple GUI where files can be selected for information extraction. The data
is then save into a .txt file which can be imported easily into Excel.

## Planned Version 1.5
Error handling when creating new files and improvement to the GUI.

## Planned Version 2.0
SQL integration. Instead of saving the information to a .txt the data will be
saved into a database. Also, instead of saving the data to a separate file, 
an .xls file will be created which will remove the import-step of the process.
